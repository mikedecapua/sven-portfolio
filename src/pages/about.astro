    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-6 border-b border-gray-700 pb-2">About Me</h1>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
      I'm Mike DeCapua.  A senior technical writer with 15+ years of experience transforming complex software into clear, concise, developer-focused documentation.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
      My background includes API reference docs, SDK guides, user manuals, and interactive simulations. I specialize in REST APIs, onboarding flows, and automating documentation pipelines.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
      I believe great docs are as important as great code because they reduce friction, build trust, and help users move fast.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
      When I am not writing, I am reading postmodern fiction, powerlifting, or exploring minimalist design and lifestyle.

    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-6 border-b border-gray-700 pb-2">About This Site</h1>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
       This site is part of my journey into developer-focused documentation. 
       I built it using Astro, a fast and modern static site generator.
       The content is written in Markdown and managed with Git, reflecting the same tooling developers use for product and API documentation.
       By building this site myself, I have gained hands-on experience with version control, deployment workflows, and clean, 
       component-based content structure, all skills relevant to writing and managing developer docs.
