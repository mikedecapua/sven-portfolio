          Here you will find an overview of who I am, including my background, writing samples, and career highlights. 
          Whether you're a potential collaborator, recruiter, 
          or just curious about my work, feel free to explore and reach out if youâ€™d like to connect.

          This site is also a living example of my evolving skills. 
          I built it using Astro and continue to update it as I learn new tools and techniques, 
          especially as I transition from user-focused documentation to developer-focused content. 
          Thanks for stopping by.
